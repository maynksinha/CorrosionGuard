## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technology       |
|-------------|------------------|
| Frontend    | React with TypeScript |
| Backend     | Flask (Python)   |
| ML Model    | TensorFlow / PyTorch (specify your model) |
| Styling     | Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules (adjust based on your code) |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User uploads an image** of a machine surface.
2. **Frontend** sends the image to the backend via a POST request.
3. **Flask backend** processes the image and feeds it into a trained ML model.
4. **Prediction result** (corroded / not corroded) is returned and displayed on the frontend.
